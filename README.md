# Malavya Raval

### Hello there 👋

I am a graduate international student in Computer Science at San Francisco State University.
I have experience working on my website and various database projects, using languages such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. 
Additionally, I have completed over 100 LeetCode questions to further improve my skills. 
During an internship where I worked with Java, I was the team lead and utilized tools such as Eclipse.
Outside of academics, I enjoy playing football, PC gaming, and cycling.
I also have experience working with an NGO in India, and am interested in collaborating on any projects that will allow me to learn and grow.
